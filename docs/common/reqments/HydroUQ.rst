Requirements
************

The purpose of presenting these requirements is to inform the community about the present capabilities of the **HydroUQ application** and features that could be added. The original set of requirements has come from a set of grand challenge reports, **GC**. These original requirements have been broken into a smaller set of deliverable features by the senior faculty associated with the project, **SP**. Additional requirements have come from users, **U** See section :ref:`features` if you have additional features you would like to see.

HydroUQ Requirements - General
------------------------------
The following are the requirements for the response of a single structure due to wave or hydrodynamic loading effects of water caused by a tsunami or coastal inundation during a hurricane. The requirements are being met by the Hydro-UQ application. All requirements in this section are related to work in WBS 1.3.7.
