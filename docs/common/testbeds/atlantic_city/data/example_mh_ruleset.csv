Notes,"3280.306 (d) Requirements for ties. Manufactured homes in Wind Zone I require only diagonal ties. These ties shall be placed along the main frame and below the outer side walls. All manufactured homes designed to be located in Wind Zones II and III shall have a vertical tie installed at each diagonal tie location. Wind Zones I, II and III are defined as having design wind speeds of 70mph, 100mph and 110 mph, respectively. (Table 3280.305)
The HUD Code was amended in 1994 with requirements that manufactured homes meet building and installation standards to provide wind safety safeguards in pre-designated storm regions of the country. Manufactured homes produced since 1994 have been proven to be equal and, in many respects, safer than site-built homes during tornadoes and hurricanes. `More details <http://www.homespotonline.com/blog/what-you-need-know-about-manufactured-homes/>`_","The HUD Code was amended in 1994 with requirements that manufactured homes meet building and installation standards to provide wind safety safeguards in pre-designated storm regions of the country, therefore tie downs were not required by code before 1994. However, it is recommended that all manufactured homes install tie downs. Therefore, this ruleset assumes roughly the same percentage voluntary compliance as shutters before 1994, meaning, 45% of  manufactured homes under the 1976 HUD codes should be randomly assigned to have tie-downs, and 55% should not.
